# Inspiration behind our Project
The challenges that green kiosk vendors face on a daily basis are staggering, especially in the midst of a global pandemic, but their unwavering dedication to their families, communities, and trade has proven invaluable in a time of decreased food security and accessibility of suppliers. Investing in their businesses and communities has effectively kept thousands of people fed and will continue to do so in the near future.

# Project description

This project is a web application that aims to help green kiosk vendors get  fresh fruits and vegetables sourced from farmers in Kenya. It will be built and Inspired by Akirachix Software Engineering students based on the problems green kiosk vendors face while trying to access fresh fruits and vegetables.

A typical day for a green kiosk vendor begins at 4 a.m, when they begin their journey to a regional produce market. Once there, they haggle with brokers who control inventory and frequently subject them to unforeseeable and unfair price fluctuations. After purchasing their produce, they return home, set up their stand, and work long hours until everything is gone. They frequently do this while caring for their children and families at home. It's a demanding lifestyle that often results in little profit after a long day's work.

Greenbanda's goal is to ensure that green kiosk vendors receive fresh products directly from suppliers, hence boosting the supply chain.

With the innovative world, we decided to develop a Web app, hosted on a public domain, preferably greensbanda.co.ke, to assist green kiosk vendors in easily accessing suppliers. This ensures that vendors receive products from a reliable supplier, transparent pricing, and that long journeys are avoided.
